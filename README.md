## Get you location data
I have a Google Pixel, all my location data is easily stored by Google and I can request archives (note sometimes there is a delay in getting the data).

*At time of writing this was the best way to get your Google Location Data*

1. Go to your Google Account.
2. On the left navigation panel, click Data & personalization.
3. On the Download, delete, or make a plan for your data panel, click Download your data.
4. Choose which Google products to include in your download. To see more details and options for a product, select the Down arrow Down Arrow.
5. Select Next.
6. Choose your archive's "File type." *this code uses Json*
I found best way was to email you a link to the download
7. For "Delivery method," select Send download link via email.
8. Choose Create archive.
9. In the email that arrives, click Download archive.
10. To download your data, follow the onscreen instructions.
